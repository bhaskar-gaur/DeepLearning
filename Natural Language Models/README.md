 1. [IMDB Movie Review - Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/vvshankar78/DeepLearning/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Models/imdb)

     This project involves using Fastai for training language model on IMDB review text using pretrained Wikitext103 Language model. Further the trained IMBD model is used for classification of movie reviews using encoding. Achieves 94% accuracy. Techniques used are - topic modeling, LSTM, Transfer Learning, deep learning.


 2. [Chatbot Response Similarity Analysis](https://github.com/vvshankar78/DeepLearning/tree/master/Natural%20Language%20Models/Chatbot%20Response%20similarity)

    This project contains set of questions and response to the question in a chatbot environment. The objective is to train an NLP model that predicts the similarity between the question and response based on the data provided. This project was done Fastai for training language model using pretrained Wikitext103 Language model. Further the trained chatbot based trained model is used for classifier of to predict the similarity of chatbot transaction using encoding. Achieves 90% accuracy. Techniques used are - topic modeling, LSTM, Transfer Learning, deep learning.
